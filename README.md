# Text_classification_to_topics
It consists of machine learning model developed to classify the text to the topic it belongs. I have primarily used **Naive Bayes** classifier.  

## 📄 Description

The dataset consist of two columns, one is 'Text' where the text data is given and another is 'Target' where corresponding class of topic for the text data is given. we have to classify the text to its true class of topic.

I have used **Naive Bayes classifier** with oversampling and also built a model for same data using **SVM**
